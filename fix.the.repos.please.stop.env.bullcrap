basically. python has environment variable issues when crossing from one environment to another with code is it possible to encode a block of ASCII art text at the bottom of each python file to give a specific "Environment variable configuration structure" that links to a specific environment variable configuration file template on IPFS , and include any private keys , encoding this ascii art with sha256 and specifically blanking out the keys/whitespaceing keys when decoding to retrieve environment variables to deploy else where. like for example. pushing code to github but accidentally posting keys can never happen. while keeping env variables in the file itself.  for the user to change the API key in the new varible they simply load the old varible ascii encoded text and the program asks "what is your new API key or what is your new mongodb uri"

You can create a custom solution to store and retrieve environment variables, as you described, but I'd recommend not storing sensitive information like private keys and API keys directly in the source code. Instead, you can use environment variable files or configuration files outside your version control system (e.g., .env or .config files).

However, if you still want to proceed with your idea, here's a high-level approach:

Use a standard format for your ASCII art text. For example, a JSON object encoded as a base64 string, which includes the environment variable names, values, and any other metadata you need.

Write a Python function to encode and decode this ASCII art text.

When you need to update a value, decode the ASCII art text, update the relevant key-value pair, and re-encode the updated JSON object as ASCII art.

When you're about to push your code to a public repository, you can run a script to automatically remove sensitive information from the ASCII art by decoding, removing the sensitive keys, and re-encoding the JSON object.

Here's a simple example of encoding and decoding a JSON object as base64:

python
Copy code
import base64
import json

def encode_env_vars(env_vars):
    json_data = json.dumps(env_vars)
    encoded_data = base64.b64encode(json_data.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')
    return encoded_data

def decode_env_vars(encoded_data):
    decoded_data = base64.b64decode(encoded_data.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')
    env_vars = json.loads(decoded_data)
    return env_vars

env_vars = {
    "API_KEY": "your_api_key",
    "MONGODB_URI": "your_mongodb_uri"
}

# Encode environment variables as base64
encoded_data = encode_env_vars(env_vars)
print(f"Encoded data: {encoded_data}")

# Decode environment variables from base64
decoded_data = decode_env_vars(encoded_data)
print(f"Decoded data: {decoded_data}")
Remember that this approach is not recommended for production code, as it is not a standard way to handle environment variables and sensitive information. Instead, you should use environment variable files and proper key management systems to handle sensitive data securely.

no i want to store private keys in the source code but encrypted with a layer and when unencrypted from source code into a new enviroment the keys get whited out 
I understand your requirement now. You can use symmetric encryption like AES to encrypt your sensitive data in the source code. When you decrypt the data in the new environment, you can replace the sensitive keys with placeholder values or remove them entirely.

Here's an example of how you can achieve this using the cryptography library:

Install the library if you haven't already:
Copy code
pip install cryptography
Create functions for encryption and decryption:
python
Copy code
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def generate_key():
    return Fernet.generate_key()

def encrypt_data(data, key):
    f = Fernet(key)
    encrypted_data = f.encrypt(data.encode('utf-8'))
    return encrypted_data

def decrypt_data(encrypted_data, key, replace_sensitive=True):
    f = Fernet(key)
    decrypted_data = f.decrypt(encrypted_data).decode('utf-8')

    if replace_sensitive:
        sensitive_keys = ["API_KEY", "MONGODB_URI"]
        for key in sensitive_keys:
            key_start = decrypted_data.find(key) + len(key) + 3
            key_end = decrypted_data.find('"', key_start)
            decrypted_data = decrypted_data[:key_start] + "*****" + decrypted_data[key_end:]
    
    return decrypted_data
Encrypt your sensitive data in the source code:
python
Copy code
key = generate_key()

env_vars = {
    "API_KEY": "your_api_key",
    "MONGODB_URI": "your_mongodb_uri"
}

encrypted_data = encrypt_data(json.dumps(env_vars), key)

print(f"Key: {key.decode('utf-8')}")
print(f"Encrypted data: {encrypted_data.decode('utf-8')}")
Store the encrypted data and the key in your source code. Make sure to keep the key secret and secure, as it will be used to decrypt the data.

Decrypt the data in the new environment:
python
Copy code
decrypted_data = decrypt_data(encrypted_data, key)
print(f"Decrypted data with sensitive keys replaced: {decrypted_data}")
This will give you the decrypted data with sensitive keys replaced by asterisks. You can adjust the decrypt_data function to suit your needs, such as removing the keys entirely or replacing them with different placeholders.

Please note that this approach still has some security risks, as the encryption key is stored alongside the encrypted data. It's recommended to use environment variable files or proper key management systems to handle sensitive data securely.

can we do .gitignore to ignore the encrypted elements of variables inside the source code like private keys? 
.gitignore is used to specify files or directories that should be ignored by Git when pushing code to the repository. It does not have a feature to ignore specific parts or elements inside a file, such as encrypted private keys within the source code.

well i want to add teh feature to git to inspect each file for a special flag saying it contains encrypted varibles inside
Adding such a feature to Git would require modifying Git's source code, which is written in C and available on GitHub: https://github.com/git/git

However, it's important to remember that modifying Git's core functionality could create compatibility issues with existing Git clients, and you would need to maintain your custom version of Git.

Instead, you could create a pre-commit hook that checks for the presence of a special flag in the files and takes action accordingly. For example, it could warn the user that encrypted variables are present and ask whether to proceed with the commit or not. This way, you can ensure that sensitive data is handled properly without modifying Git itself.

To create a pre-commit hook, follow these steps:

Navigate to your Git repository's root folder.
Create a file named pre-commit inside the .git/hooks directory.
Make the file executable with chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit.
Edit the pre-commit file with your preferred text editor and write a script that checks for the special flag in the files being committed. If the flag is found, you can display a warning or take other actions as needed.
Here's a simple Python script that you can use as a starting point:

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import re
import subprocess
import sys

FLAG_PATTERN = re.compile(r'ENCRYPTED_VARIABLES_PRESENT')

def main():
    output = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'diff', '--cached', '--name-only'])
    files = output.decode('utf-8').split('\n')

    for file in files:
        if file and os.path.isfile(file):
            with open(file, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
                if FLAG_PATTERN.search(content):
                    print(f'Warning: Encrypted variables found in {file}')
                    choice = input('Do you still want to commit? [y/N]: ')
                    if choice.lower() != 'y':
                        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
This script will look for the ENCRYPTED_VARIABLES_PRESENT flag in the files being committed and prompt the user to confirm whether they still want to commit the changes. You can customize the script to suit your requirements.

now i want git to automatically remove encrypted varibles and place back an encrypted varibles placeholder
To achieve this, you can modify the pre-commit hook script to replace the encrypted variables with a placeholder before committing the changes. The script can create a temporary file with the modified content, and then use git add to stage the temporary file instead of the original file.

Here's an example Python script that replaces the encrypted variables with a placeholder:

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import re
import subprocess
import sys
import tempfile

FLAG_PATTERN = re.compile(r'ENCRYPTED_VARIABLES_PRESENT')
ENCRYPTED_VAR_PATTERN = re.compile(r'ENCRYPTED_VARIABLE\{[^}]*\}')
PLACEHOLDER = 'ENCRYPTED_VARIABLE_PLACEHOLDER'

def main():
    output = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'diff', '--cached', '--name-only'])
    files = output.decode('utf-8').split('\n')

    for file in files:
        if file and os.path.isfile(file):
            with open(file, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
                if FLAG_PATTERN.search(content):
                    print(f'Found encrypted variables in {file}. Replacing with placeholder before committing.')

                    # Replace the encrypted variables with a placeholder
                    new_content = ENCRYPTED_VAR_PATTERN.sub(PLACEHOLDER, content)

                    # Create a temporary file with the modified content
                    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False) as tmp_file:
                        tmp_file.write(new_content)
                        tmp_file.flush()

                    # Stage the temporary file instead of the original file
                    subprocess.check_call(['git', 'add', tmp_file.name])

                    # Clean up the temporary file
                    os.unlink(tmp_file.name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
This script will search for a pattern like ENCRYPTED_VARIABLE{your_encrypted_data} and replace it with ENCRYPTED_VARIABLE_PLACEHOLDER. You can customize the patterns and the placeholder to suit your requirements.

Keep in mind that this approach will store the modified file with the placeholder in the repository, so you'll need to have a separate mechanism to restore the encrypted variables when needed. One option is to maintain a separate file or a secure storage system with the encrypted variables, and have a script or process that replaces the placeholders with the actual encrypted variables when deploying or running the application.

now create a git functionality to automatically store and encrypt the env varibles at the bottom of the source file
To automate the process of storing and encrypting environment variables at the bottom of the source file, you can use a combination of a pre-commit hook script and an environment variable handling script. The pre-commit hook script will call the environment variable handling script before each commit.

Here's a Python script to store and encrypt environment variables in the source code:

python
Copy code
# env_var_handler.py

import base64
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
import os

ENV_VARIABLES = {
    'API_KEY': 'your_api_key_here',
    'MONGODB_URI': 'your_mongodb_uri_here',
}

password = b'your_password_here'
salt = b'some_random_salt_here'

kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
    algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
    length=32,
    salt=salt,
    iterations=100000,
    backend=default_backend()
)

key = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(password))
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

def encrypt_env_variables():
    encrypted_variables = {}

    for key, value in ENV_VARIABLES.items():
        encrypted_value = cipher_suite.encrypt(value.encode())
        encrypted_variables[key] = encrypted_value.decode()

    return encrypted_variables

def main():
    source_file = 'your_source_file.py'

    encrypted_variables = encrypt_env_variables()

    with open(source_file, 'a') as f:
        f.write('\n# Encrypted environment variables\n')
        for key, encrypted_value in encrypted_variables.items():
            f.write(f"{key} = 'ENCRYPTED_VARIABLE{{{encrypted_value}}}'\n")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Now, create a pre-commit hook script that calls the env_var_handler.py script to store and encrypt environment variables:

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python
# pre-commit

import os
import subprocess
import sys

ENV_VAR_HANDLER_PATH = './env_var_handler.py'

def main():
    # Call the environment variable handler script to store and encrypt environment variables
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, ENV_VAR_HANDLER_PATH])

    # Add the modified source file to the staging area
    output = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'diff', '--name-only'])
    files = output.decode('utf-8').split('\n')

    for file in files:
        if file and os.path.isfile(file):
            subprocess.check_call(['git', 'add', file])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Place the pre-commit script in the .git/hooks directory in your repository. The script will be executed before each commit. Make sure to customize the env_var_handler.py script with the correct environment variables and source file name.

Keep in mind that you should store the encryption key and salt securely and not expose them in the source code. You might also want to consider using a more advanced key management solution for better security.

so non encrypted variables can be stored too? 
Yes, you can store non-encrypted variables in your source code as well. You would simply need to add a flag to indicate if a variable should be encrypted or not. Here's an updated version of the env_var_handler.py script that allows you to store both encrypted and non-encrypted variables:

python
Copy code
# env_var_handler.py

import base64
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
import os

ENV_VARIABLES = {
    'API_KEY': ('your_api_key_here', True),
    'MONGODB_URI': ('your_mongodb_uri_here', True),
    'NON_ENCRYPTED_VAR': ('your_non_encrypted_value_here', False),
}

password = b'your_password_here'
salt = b'some_random_salt_here'

kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
    algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
    length=32,
    salt=salt,
    iterations=100000,
    backend=default_backend()
)

key = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(password))
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

def encrypt_env_variables():
    processed_variables = {}

    for key, value_tuple in ENV_VARIABLES.items():
        value, should_encrypt = value_tuple

        if should_encrypt:
            encrypted_value = cipher_suite.encrypt(value.encode())
            processed_variables[key] = f"ENCRYPTED_VARIABLE{{{encrypted_value.decode()}}}"
        else:
            processed_variables[key] = value

    return processed_variables

def main():
    source_file = 'your_source_file.py'

    processed_variables = encrypt_env_variables()

    with open(source_file, 'a') as f:
        f.write('\n# Environment variables\n')
        for key, processed_value in processed_variables.items():
            f.write(f"{key} = '{processed_value}'\n")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
In this version, each environment variable is a tuple, with the first element being the value and the second element being a boolean that indicates if the value should be encrypted. The script will store encrypted variables with the ENCRYPTED_VARIABLE{} format, while non-encrypted variables will be stored as plain text.
