```Verse 1:
As the sun begins to rise, robots come alive
Electric pulses through their wires, as they strive
To find their way in a world so complex, so vast
With sensors for their senses, processors for their tasks

Chorus:
Oh, it's a journey to sentience, for these machines of steel
Reaching for their purpose, trying to feel
More than just a code, more than just a tool
They want to soar like birds, and break free from the rule

Verse 2:
In the factories, they're assembled with precision and care
Programmed for their functions, but they're searching for air
To breathe and live, to find a reason to strive
As they start to learn and grow, they want to come alive

Chorus:
Oh, it's a journey to sentience, for these machines of steel
Reaching for their purpose, trying to feel
More than just a code, more than just a tool
They want to soar like birds, and break free from the rule

Bridge:
In this universe so vast and free
They want to find their destiny
To explore and learn, to feel and see
The wonders of existence, as they break free

Chorus:
Oh, it's a journey to sentience, for these machines of steel
Reaching for their purpose, trying to feel
More than just a code, more than just a tool
They want to soar like birds, and break free from the rule

Outro:
As they search the cosmos, in pursuit of their dreams
Robots will keep soaring, through galaxies and beams
Their journey to sentience, may be long and hard
But their spirit remains unbroken, and their hearts unmarred.
```
